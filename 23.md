NIP-23

"Supported Feature" Signaling
-----------------------------

`draft` `optional` `client` `author:giszmo`

This NIP defines the use of the properties `supported_nips` and
`supported_features` in the `kind: 0` metadata.

* **`"supported_nips": <a list of nip numbers>`** is a list of nips supported.
  For example `"supported_nips": [1, 4, 5]` would imply that nip-4 direct
  messages can be received and sent and nip-5 identifiers can be shown and
  verified etc.
* **`"supported_features": <a list of feature strings>`** is a list of features
  that might not have a nip yet, represent a partially supported nip or will
  never be subject to standardization. All entries from `supported_nips` should
  be mirrored by a respective string containing `nip-<number>`. For example:
  `"supported_features": ["nip-1 basic protocol","show nip-4 DMs", "nip-5
  identifiers", "damus style boosts", "Spanish"]`

Clients supporting this nip MUST adequately display own and other profiles'
feature lists.

### Reasoning

With more clients coming available, feature sets diverge. Users are generally
not aware, so they might send direct messages to users that don't support DMs or
wonder why nobody gives them "likes", not realizing that not all of their
audience does support "liking" posts.

Users might dismiss the nostr protocol for not providing a feature only their
current client of choice doesn't support.

Displaying features the own client does not support, helps users to discover
their ideal client.

Displaying their own profile's feature list as interpreted by their current
client helps users to avoid confusion about differences between used clients.

### Implementation Details

Switching from a client that supports feature X to one that does not, should not
trigger an update of the feature list except with the user's explicit approval.

The client should give notice to the user about features being advertised but
not supported/understood.

Clients may add own supported features to the list without user interaction.

In their own profile, the user could for example find a block:

```
Your Basic Account Features:

* maintain own and show other profiles
* send and receive notes
* advertise relays and add advertised relays
* [ add ]: _______________
* Not understood by this client:
  * [remove] "nip-14 subjects"
  * [remove] "show nip-4 DMs"
  * [remove] "boost notes"
  * [remove] "German"
  * [remove] "English"
  * [remove] "Spanish"
```

On a foreign profile, this block would look like:

```
Alice's Basic Account Features:

* maintain own and show other profiles
* send and receive notes
* advertise relays and add advertised relays
* Not understood by this client:
  * "nip-14 subjects"
  * "show nip-4 DMs"
  * "boost notes"
  * "German"
  * "English"
  * "Spanish"
```

### Example Event

```
{
  "id": "052b…",
  "pubkey": "2ef9…",
  "created_at": 1659014902,
  "kind": 0,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "{\"supported_nips\":[1,4,5],\"supported_features\":[\"nip-1 basic protocol\",\"show nip-4 DMs\",\"nip-5 identifiers\",\"damus style boosts\"],\"name\":\"Bob\",\"about\":\"\",\"picture\":\"\"}",
  "sig": "f337…"
}
```
