Prevent Data Deletion in Replaceable Events
-------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `client` `author:giszmo`

## Replaceable Events

A *replaceable event* as defined in [NIP-01](01.md) and [NIP-16](16.md).

## Client Behavior

Clients MUST NOT change or delete Data they do not understand without user
confirmation.

Rationale
---------

### Different extensions to a feature

Clients differ in their feature sets and as nips expand kinds, clients that do
not consider unsupported parameters remove those when "replacing" events,
breaking the clients' compatibility.

Alice uses Branle at home and Damus on mobile. She configured `nip05` on Branle
but when storing her `screen_name` on Damus using the kind `0` metadata, her
`nip05` configuration disappeard. When configuring this on Damus again, her
`screen_name` disappeared from her metadata.

Bob's client invited him to define [NIO-02](02.md) petnames. And so he did. For
all 200 follows. On his different mobile client he added his follow 201 and all
petnames were gone.

### Different features using the same `kind`

There will be collisions between kinds where data stored in a replaceable event
by one client means something completely different than what another client
would want to store there.

Carol found this novel dating website and configured her (nostr kind `10101`)
profile. Some time later she installed that game using her common identity
thanks to [NIO-07](07.md) and all her dating app configuration was gone.
