NIP-33
======

Parameterized Replaceable Events
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol` `author:Kukks` `author:Cameri` `author:fiatjaf`

This NIP adds a new event range that allows for replacement of events that have
the same `d` tag and kind unlike NIP-16 "replaceable event" which only replaced
by kind.

Implementation
--------------
A *parameterized replaceable event* is defined as an event with a kind `30000 <= n < 40000`.
Upon a parameterized replaceable event with a newer timestamp than the currently known latest replaceable event with the same kind and first `d` tag being received, the old event SHOULD be discarded and replaced with the newer event.  
A missing `d` tag should be interpreted equivalent to a `d` tag without or with
empty value. Events from the same author with any of the following `tags`
replace each other:

* `"tags":[["d",""]]`
* `"tags":[]`: implicit `d` tag with empty value
* `"tags":[["d"]]`: implicit empty value `""`
* `"tags":[["d",""],["d","not empty"]]`: only first `d` tag is considered
* `"tags":[["d"],["d","some value"]]`: only first `d` tag is considered
* `"tags":[["e"]]`: same as no tags
