NIP-34
======

Parameterized Versioned Events
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Giszmo`

This NIP adds a new event range that allows for versioning of events that have
the same author, first `d` tag and kind but unlike [NIP-33](/33.md), no events
get discarded, keeping references by event ID intact.

Reasoning
---------
For maintaining bodies of events between multiple authors, relying on the
good-will of others to not change or delete their respective events is not good
enough. For example for wikipedia or nip registry replacements, we need ways to
know an acceptable version of the document stays around without having to copy
it under another author's pubkey.

Implementation
--------------
A *Parameterized Versioned Event* is defined as an event with a kind
`40000 <= n < 50000`.

It follows the same rules as NIP-33 except that "replaced" events do not get
discarded.

Relays queried for `author:kind:d-tag` tuples serve the last but when queried
for specific event IDs, those will be returned, too.

A Use Case
----------
A later nip might define a nip registry such that authors can either publish
their own preferred version of a nip or e**n**dorse others by
`author:kind:d-tag` tuples or by event ID.

Alice proposes NIP-999:

```
"author": $alice,
"id": "14aeb..8dad4",
"kind": 40001,
"tags": [
   [ "d", "999"],
…
```

Bob endorses exactly that version:

```
"author": $bob,
"kind": 40001,
"tags": [
    [ "d", "999"],
    [ "n", "14aeb..8dad4"]
],
"content": "",
…
```

Carol endorses whatever Bob wants to see as NIP-999:

```
"author": $carol,
"kind": 40001,
"tags": [
    ["d", "999"],
    ["n", "$bob:999"],
],
"content": "",
…
```

Dave announces to generally trust Alice in all things "NIP":

```
"author": $dave,
"kind": 40001,
"tags": [
    ["n", $alice,
],
"content": "",
…
```
